# Process and Thread Management

A project to explore process and thread management using POSIX and Pthreads by implementing both process-based and threaded solutions, and then comparing their performance.

## Summary
In this task we implemented two versions of a parallelizable computational task using both processes and threads. In Part 1, we created a program that uses fork() to spawn child processes and employs pipes (or shared memory) for inter-process communication (IPC). In Part 2, we implemented multithreaded processing using Pthreads to coordinate concurrent task execution and manage access to shared data. Part 3 involves measuring and comparing the execution times of the process-based and thread-based solutions, varying the number of processes/threads to evaluate scalability. Finally, Part 4 focuses on managing threads by creating joinable and detached threads and analyzing the impact of join versus detach on throughput. Throughout the project, proper error handling, resource cleanup, and documentation are required.
